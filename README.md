### Hi, 

I am [Hayden Fuller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayden-f-0b1110154/), I'm a junior full-stack developer with an interest in automation, data, aesthetics and all things JavaScript. I'd love to do anything that has a beneficial impact on society / earth. It could be working within healthcare, energy, teaching, honestly anywhere and anything with a positive impact! I just want to go home feeling happy with my contributions to the world.

```javascript
    const hayden = {
        code: [JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, HTML/CSS],
        other: [Node, React, Git/Github, GraphQL, NoSQL, SQL],
   	challenges: "This year I want to be hired as a full-time junior developer, first clients on side project,
    read 1 book a month"
  }
```
